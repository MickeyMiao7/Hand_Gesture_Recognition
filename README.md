## Hand Gesture Recognition 


### Introduction 
This project is to classify hand images into predefined gesture categories. 
Our group use two kinds of methods: the first is using SIFT, K-Means, SVM and the second is the deep learning way.
The root folder contains two subfolders:

```
SIFT_Method 
Deep_Learning_Method
```

To get explicit info of each method, please refer to the README.md in each subfolder respectively.

#### Note: 
You can also see the project from out github [https://github.com/MickeyMiao7/Hand_Gesture_Recognition](https://github.com/MickeyMiao7/Hand_Gesture_Recognition)
